Microprocessor 8085
The block diagram shows that the computer has four component : memory input,out and the central processing unit, which consist of the arithmetic/logic unit and control unit. The CPU contain various reister to store data , the ALU to perform arithmetic and logical operations , instruction decoders, counters, and control lines.
The CPU reads instruction from the memory and performs the task specified.
A computer with a microprocessor as its CPU is known as a microcomputer. The term microprocessor and microprocessor unit are often used synonymously. MPU implies a complete processing unit with necessary control signals.
Because of the limited number of available pins on a microprocessor package, some of the signals need to be generated by using discrete devices to make the microprocessor a complete functional unit or MPU.
As semiconductor fabrication technology became more advance, manufacturers were able to place not only MPU but also memory and I/O interfacing circuits on a single chip, this is known as a microcontroller or microcontroller unit (MPU). 
A microcontroller is essentially an entire computer on a single chip. The microcontroller chip also includes additional devices such as an A/D conveter, serial I/O, and timers.
Advance semiconductor Technology
Since 1950, semiconductor technology has undergone unprecedented changes. After the Invention of the transistor, integrated circuits (ICs) appeared on the scene at the end of the 1950; an entire circuit consisting of several transistors, diodes, and resistors could be designed on a single chip.
